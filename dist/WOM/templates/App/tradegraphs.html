Although I should not that because of trade, even domestic economic developments can and have an effect on other players, although not quite as large and certainly not quite as closely targeted as these policies. Which are:

- Import Tariffs (TariffAm) levy a tax on all goods imported from a given country. That tax is added on top of the good's price, so a 50% tariff would multiply the price by 1.5
- Export Tariffs (SanctionAm) are the same as Import Tariffs, only the tax is put on goods leaving your country and going to that other country
- Sending Money (SendMoney) is pretty straightforward, although note that you send money at current exchange rates. To get the exchange rate, multiply how many $ you get per unit of your currency (you can see that in the exchange rate chart), and then divide by the other player's exchange rate. The money you're sending is listed in your currency
- Sending Military Equipment (MilitarySend) is actually pretty straightforward. You just send it, and the other player can use it in the same turn as the one where you sent it
- Nationalization will take some or all of the say  French-owned capital (i.e. investment goods) in your country, to citizens of your own country. That is, if you select the Nationalization policy in regards to France of course. If the value you enter is 100% (default), nothing is nationalized. If it's 90%, then 90% will remain after this year (i.e. 10% is nationalized every year), etc, all the way to 0% nationalizing everything.">ℹ️ </span></legend>
